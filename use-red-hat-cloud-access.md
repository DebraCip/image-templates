# Using Red Hat Cloud Access 

When you create an image template with a VHD image, you can select to provide your own operating system license through the [Red Hat Cloud 
Access ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access) subscription.

If you deploy an image in {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} that indicates you are using your own license through Red Hat Cloud Access, the following support terms exist:
* IBM provides support for hypervisors, provisioning instances, importing images, rebooting an image, reloading an OS, and capturing an image.
* Red Hat provides support for the image itself. IBM does not provide support for the image.

For more information about our certification as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux cloud provider, see [Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://access.redhat.com/ecosystem/cloud-provider/2262101).
